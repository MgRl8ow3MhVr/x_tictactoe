When I was bored in a classroom in highschool, I used to take a blank graph paper out of my bag, cross a first square, pass it to my neighbour and this was the beginning of long game of tic tac toe with no boundaries ! Any line of 4 X's or O's was worth one point.
Here is the modern desktop version of it ! Enter a username and challenge anybody who is connected

## technologies

Frontend: Node.js, React, CSS, Axios,
Backend: Node.js, express, websocket,

## next steps

More than 2 players play together(X vs O vs Y vs Z for example). Add a chatroom. Add a Database to save an on going game. Make it responsive for phone size, make an App out of it !
